- [Info page](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/clms/placement-exam.htm)
- Dates
	- May 1: Get your UWNetId if you don't have one
	- May 1 - June 1: Take the test 
	- June 15: Your test is graded and feedback is provided
	- Mid-July: Ling473 (the refresher course) starts
	- Late Sept: Ling570 starts

## Test Sections
- **Formal language, formal grammar, and finite state machines**:
	- This part tests your knowledge on topics such as regular expression, regular grammar, context-free grammar, context-free language, finite state automata, and finite state transducer.
- **Probability and statistics**:
	- Topics such as random variables, Bayesâ€™ rule, independence and conditional independence, Bernoulli distribution, Gaussian distribution, Chain rule.
- **Programming**:
	- This part assesses whether you have sufficient experience with programming. You will be asked to write short programs (which you can test on your computer). You can choose to program in one of the following languages: C/C++, Java, Perl, or Python. You should also be familiar with the usage of pattern matching in the programming language of your choice and issues such as the time/space complexity of an algorithm.
- **Unix, algorithm, data structure, and linguistics basics**:
	- Topics include common Unix commands, common data structures (e.g., array, stack, queue, hash table, binary tree, sorting algorithms, time/space complexity of an algorithm), and linguistics basics (part-of-speech tags, syntactic structure).

## After Test
- You have passed the test and met the prerequisite for the LING 570 series.
- You are missing only a small amount of background information, which we think you can make up with self-study.
- You have done reasonably well but miss certain knowledge required for the series, and should take the summer refresher course that starts in July.
- You are missing some crucial pieces that are essential for the series, and should take prerequisite courses such as CSE 373 (Data structures and algorithms) and MATH/STAT 394 (Probability).
