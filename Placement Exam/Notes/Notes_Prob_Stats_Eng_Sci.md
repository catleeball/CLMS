# Chapter 1
*Overview and Descriptive Statistics*

## Ch 1.1

##### *Pg.3*

**Data**: Collection of facts, observations, etc

**Population** well-defined collection of objects

**Census**: Info available for all objects in population

**Sample**: Subset of population to study

**Variable**: Any characteristic that may vary between objects in a population

**Univariate**: Data set of observations on a single variable
> e.g. Set of cars, variable is transmission type (manual or automatic), making a *categorical univariate data set*: {M,A,A,A,M,A,M,...}

> e.g. Set of patients, variable is heart BPM, the *numerical univariate data set*: {88, 80, 71, 103, ...}

##### *Pg.4*

**Bivariate, Multivariate**: As above, but with two or more variables

**Descriptive statistics**: Methods of describing & summarizing data
> *e.g.* Visual summary: scatter plot, histogram, box plot, etc

> *e.g.* Numerical summery: mean, std dev, correlation coefficient, etc

##### *Pg.6*

> *"The main focus of this book is on presenting and illustrating methods of inferential statistics that are useful in scientific work."*

**Ch 2-5**: Probability. Segues from descriptive to inferential techniques.

**Ch 6-8:** Important types of inferential procedures: point estimation, hypothesis testing, estimation by confidence intervals

**Ch 9-16:** More complex uses of inf methods

**Probability**: Properties of population are assumed known, questions about sample posed & answered

*"Probability reasons from the population to the sample (deductive reasoning)"*

**Statistics**: Characteristics of population are available, allows experimenter to draw conclusions about population.

*"Inferential statistics reasons from sample to population (inductive reasoning)"*

> *"Before we can understand what a particular sample can tell us about the population, we should first understand the uncertainty associated with taking a sample from a given population. This is why we study probability before statistics."*
