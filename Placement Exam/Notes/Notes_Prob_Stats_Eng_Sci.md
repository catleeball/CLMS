# Chapter 1
*Overview and Descriptive Statistics*

## Ch 1.1

##### *Pg.3*

**Data**: Collection of facts, observations, etc

**Population** well-defined collection of objects

**Census**: Info available for all objects in population

**Sample**: Subset of population to study

**Variable**: Any characteristic that may vary between objects in a population

**Univariate**: Data set of observations on a single variable
> e.g. Set of cars, variable is transmission type (manual or automatic), making a *categorical univariate data set*: {M,A,A,A,M,A,M,...}

> e.g. Set of patients, variable is heart BPM, the *numerical univariate data set*: {88, 80, 71, 103, ...}

##### *Pg.4*

**Bivariate, Multivariate**: As above, but with two or more variables

**Descriptive statistics**: Methods of describing & summarizing data
> *e.g.* Visual summary: scatter plot, histogram, box plot, etc

> *e.g.* Numerical summery: mean, std dev, correlation coefficient, etc

##### *Pg.6*

> *"The main focus of this book is on presenting and illustrating methods of inferential statistics that are useful in scientific work."*

**Ch 2-5**: Probability. Segues from descriptive to inferential techniques.

**Ch 6-8:** Important types of inferential procedures: point estimation, hypothesis testing, estimation by confidence intervals

**Ch 9-16:** More complex uses of inf methods

**Probability**: Properties of population are assumed known, questions about sample posed & answered

*"Probability reasons from the population to the sample (deductive reasoning)"*

**Statistics**: Characteristics of population are available, allows experimenter to draw conclusions about population.

"Inferential statistics reasons from sample to population (inductive reasoning)"*

"Before we can understand what a particular sample can tell us about the population, we should first understand the uncertainty associated with taking a sample from a given population. This is why we study probability before statistics."

*Ex 1.3*:

Probability: Ask "what percent drivers in X city wear seatbelt?", then sample 100 drivers

Inferential stats has sample info available already, e.g. a sample of 100 drivers in city X show that 65 use seatbelt; we then ask "Does this provide evidence that >50% of all drivers in this area wear seatbelts?"

Latter scenario, using sample info to answer question about the whole population from the given sample.

##### *Pg.7*

**Conceptual population / Hypothetical population**: Population consisting of all possible variables under given conditions.

##### *Pg.9*

W.E. Demming: influential American statistician introduced ***Enumerative Studies*** and ***Analytic Studies***

***Enumerative Studies***: Study focused on a finite, identifiable, unchanging collection of individuals forming a population

The ***Sampling frame*** *(list of individuals to be sampled)* is available to experimenter.

> e.g. all signatures on a petition. Sample is usually selected to determine if number of *valid* signatures exceeds a value

***Analytic Studies***: Study not enumerative in nature.

Often carried out to improve future thing by taking action on a process

> e.g. recalibrate machinery for efficiency

Data can only be obtained on an existing process that may significantly differ from the future process being formulated.

No sampling frame

> e.g. Five prototype turbines created to investigate efficiency. CAN be seen as conceptual population of all prototypes that can be manufactured under same/similar conditions, but NOT necessarily representative of those manufactured under other conditions (e.g. different production line creating non-prototype turbines)

Inferring on future from samples may have problems, likely needs a domain expert to judge if extrapolation is reasonable
