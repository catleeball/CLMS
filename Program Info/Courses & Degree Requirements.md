- [LING 550: Introduction to Linguistic Phonetics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#550)
	- [MyPlan link](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/LING550)
	- 5 credits
	- This course provides an introduction to the articulatory and acoustic correlates of phonological features. Issues covered include the mapping of dynamic events to static representations, phonetic evidence for phonological description, universal constraints on phonological structure and implications of psychological speech-sound categorization for phonological theory.
	- Prerequisites: [LING 200: Introduction to Linguistic Thought](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ling.html#ling200) or [LING 400: Survey of Linguistic Method & Theory](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ling.html#ling400)
- [LING 566: Introduction to Syntax for Computational Linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#566)
	- 3 credits
	- This course provides an introduction to syntactic analysis and concepts, including part of speech types, constituent structure, the syntax-semantics interface, and phenomena such as complementation, raising, control, and passive and long-distance dependencies. Emphasis will be placed on formal, precise encoding of linguistic hypotheses and designing grammars so they can be scaled up for practical applications. Students will progressively build a consistent grammar for a fragment of English and will work with problem sets that introduce data and phenomena from other languages.
	- Prerequisites: [LING 200: Introduction to Linguistic Thought](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ling.html#ling200) or [LING 400: Survey of Linguistic Method & Theory](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ling.html#ling400)
- [LING 570: Shallow Processing Techniques for Natural Language Processing](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#570)
	- 4 credits
	- This course covers techniques and algorithms for associating relatively surface-level structures and information with natural language corpora. Topics covered include tokenization/word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis, named-entity recognition, chunk parsing and word-sense disambiguation. Students will also be introduced to linguistic resources that can be leveraged for these tasks, such as the Penn Treebank and WordNet.
	- Prereqs:
		- [CSE 373: Data Structures & Algorithms](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/cse.html#cse373) or equivalent
		- [MATH/STAT 394: Probability I](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/math.html#math394) or equivalent
		- Basic knowledge of formal grammars, formal languages, finite state automata
		- Programming experience in Perl, C, C++, Java or Python
		- Experience with basic UNIX/Linux commands
- [LING 571: Deep Processing Techniques for Natural Language Processing](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#571)
	- 4 credits
	- This course covers algorithms for associating deep or elaborated linguistic structures with naturally occurring linguistic data, looking at syntax, semantics and discourse. It also explores algorithms that produce natural language strings from input semantic representations.

- [LING 572: Advanced Statistical Methods in Natural Language Processing](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#572)
	- 4 credits
	- This course covers several important machine learning algorithms for natural language processing, including decision tree, kNN, Naive Bayes, transformation-based learning, support vector machine, maximum entropy and conditional random field. Students implement many of the algorithms and apply these algorithms to selected NLP tasks.
	- Prereqs: LING 570
- [LING 573: Language Processing Systems & Applications](https://www.compling.uw.edu/academic-experience/courses/course-descriptions#573)
	- 4 credits
	- This course looks at building coherent NLP systems designed to tackle practical applications. Students work in groups to build a working end-to-end system for some practical application. The specific application addressed varies by year, but examples include: machine (aided) translation, speech interfaces, information retrieval/extraction, natural language query systems, dialogue systems, augmentative and alternative communication, computer-assisted language learning, language documentation/linguistic hypothesis testing, spelling and grammar checking, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition and software localization.
	- Prereqs: LING 570, LING 571, LING 572
